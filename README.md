A high level programing language created on Python. That has a really simple syntax somewhere in between C# and Python.

# Installation
To install it, go on the github `code < Download ZIP < Extract the file`

# `"Hello world!"` in Arctic-Fox
```c
printf("hello world!")
```

# Running code
There is no official IDE for Arctic-Fox, So the code must be ran from CMD. To run the file you coded, you must keep the file where the directory for `arctic.exe` then run command prompt in the same folder, and in commnad promt insert: 

`arctic.exe --[FILE NAME]`

and in place of `FILE NAME`, replace it with the name of your file containg the code!
